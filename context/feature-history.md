### 2026-07-20 — Fire tablet native companion diagnostic spike

- Added a standalone API 28 Kotlin companion with a foreground service, Android Keystore-backed
  Lounge pairing persistence, redacted diagnostics, serialized playback commands, and guarded
  reconnect/session lifecycle behavior.
- Proved SmartTube TV-code pairing, open-video, play, pause, seek, playback-state reporting, and
  encrypted credential restoration after a controlled companion process interruption on the
  Amazon KFTRWI/trona Fire tablet.
- Validated the debug APK with 15 JVM tests and `assembleDebug`; independent review found no
  remaining blocking correctness or security issues. PocketBase integration and explicit Wi-Fi
  interruption testing remain deferred.
